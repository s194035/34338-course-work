//////////Questions//////////
//How is the analog value represented by the MCU?
//Answer: The analog value read with analogRead is a number between 0-1024 because the Arduino uses a 10-bit (2^10) A/D converter. This leaves about 0.003V per unit which is pretty good precision for what we are using it for.

//What is maximum voltage that can be read on A0?
//Answer: The maximum voltage that the ARDUINO can be read is 5V.
